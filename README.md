The **Covet Buggy** is a simple mod made by merging parts from the Ibishu Covet, Autobello Piccolina Buggy and some other miscellaneous parts from offroaders and crawlers.

**Current featureset:**
- Some I4 engines from the Ibishu Covet with strengthened internals.
- Center- to 8-lug wheels.
- All the transmissions from the Ibushu Covet.

**Planned updates:**
- **[DONE!]** The F4 engines from the Autobello Piccolina.
- Various V8's.
- Driver aids (stability control, traction control).
- AWD.
- Lockable differentials for crawling.

**Known issues:**
- I am currently aware that, for some reason, the wheels like to detach at random.
- Due to the low low-end torque on the Covet I4's, the clutch likes to overheat, however i have semi-remedied this with a much heavier clutch\/flywheel.
- Due to some .jbeam weirdness some parts wobble at random, and the interior deforms slightly.

**Support\/feedback\/feature requests:**
I probably won't check this thread much, and i apologize in advance for that - However i can be contacted on Discord, either via the dedicated thread for my mod on there, or via DM's @ nitnit_
